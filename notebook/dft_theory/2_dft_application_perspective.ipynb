        "- In metals, however, the density of states is continuous at the Fermi level, and there are typically a substantial number of states that are close in energy to the Fermi level. Consequently, small changes in the energy can dramatically change the occupation numbers, resulting in instabilities that make it difficult to converge to the occupation step function. A related problem is that the Brillouin zone integral (which in practice is performed as a sum over a finite number of k points) that defines the band energy converges very slowly with the number of k points due to the discontinuity\n",
