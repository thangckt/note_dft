        "A full quantum-mechanical treatment of a material requires the calculation of the system's many-nuclei, many-electron wave functions. *(Schrödinger’s wave function, 1926)* [1,5]\n",
        "\n",
        "However, masses of the nuclei are much larger than masses of electrons, then the wave functions of atomic nuclei and electrons in a molecule can be treated separately (nuclei motion can be decoupled from electrons motions - the coordinates of the nuclei in a system are approximated as fixed, while the coordinates of the electrons are dynamic; and they may be treated as classical point-like particles *(the Born-Oppenheimer approximation, 1927)*). \n",
        "\n",
        "So, with **Born-Oppenheimer approximation/separation**, we ignore motions of nuclei and solve the Schrödinger equation for the electrons only *(called the electronic Schrödinger equation)*. The solution of the Schrödinger equation for the electrons is called the **electronic ground state** of the system. \n",
        "\n",
        "However, the electronic Schrödinger equation is impossible (so far) to solve exactly for a system with many electrons ($N_{atoms} \\times N_{electrons}$).\n",
        "\n",
        "Then, DFT provides a way to solve the electronic Schrödinger equation approximately, by replacing the many-electron wave function with a single [Slater determinant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slater_determinant) that depends on the electron density. The electron density is a function of the spatial coordinates of the electrons, and is a simpler function to work with than the many-electron wave function.\n",
        "\n",
        "The underlying principle of DFT is that the ground state total energy of a system of interacting electrons is a unique functional of the electron density *(Hohenberg and Kohn, 1964)*. However, the precise functional dependence of the energy on the density is not known. Later, *(Kohn & Sham, 1965)* transformed this DFT problem of computing the ground state energy and particle density of an N-electron system into that of solving a set of independent-particle equations. These **Koohn-Sham equations** contain a contribution from the quantum-mechanical exchange and correlation of the particles. No expression for this *exchange-correlation* (XC) potential is known. This XC is central to the success of DFT.\n",

This means that a very large number of planewaves are required to expand their wave functions. Furthermore, the contributions of the core electrons to bonding compared to those of the valence electrons is usually negligible. In fact, the primary role of the core electron wave functions is to ensure proper orthogonality between the valence electrons and core states\n",
