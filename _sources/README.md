# w23_DFT

This repo is for learning DFT calculation
Main follows guides in [this book](http://kitchingroup.cheme.cmu.edu/dft-book/dft.html)

The note at [https://thangckt.github.io/note_dft](https://thangckt.github.io/note_dft)

## 2023 Jan 25: Begin with GPAW

## 2023 Jan 24: Begin with CP2K

- Not use VASP since it requires a license (free academic, but only for a large group)
- create the repo and make some calculations with CP2K
- give up CP2K and change to using GPAW+ASE due to the convenience of usage with Python
- CP2K and VASP have more advanced functions. But GPAW may be enough for common usage
